# Daily Lab Notes – 2025-10-03

## Today's Focus
- Practiced network scanning with Nmap and Python
- Explored Wireshark filters for HTTP and TCP
- Read about basic SQL injection techniques

## Key Learnings
- Nmap `-sV` flag helps identify service versions
- Wireshark allows filtering by protocol (e.g., `http`, `tcp`)
- SQL injection can bypass login forms if inputs aren’t sanitized

## Next Steps
- Try a small Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge tomorrow
- Automate simple scans with Python scripts
